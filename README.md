# Landing-Page
this is the first project for  Front End Web Development Professional




## Landing Page Behavior
* Navigation was built dynamically as an unordered list.
* It will be showe which section has been viewed while the user scrolling through the page.
* When the user clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link will scroll to the appropriate section.
* it is a responsive website.

### the programming languages I used it 
* html for the content 
*  css for the style 
*  js for the interaction & behavior
